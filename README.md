# genportrait
Randomly generate portraits from spritesheets, picking a random head, eyes, mouth, and skin.
Right now it doesn't have hair, lip color, or eyebrow color, but that might be added later.

I always wanted to make a character creator to give the people in my projects a literal face,
so I decided to make a simple one that I can use in my projects. For now it is just a demo to
give people an idea of how these character editors were made in the past. Pretty simple tbh.

Further, I kinda regret that I used 32x32, since it is so limiting in the amount of detail I can
put in the sprites.

Please excuse the horrendous art, I'm not an artist. :)

## default colors

These were picked at random and will be replaced with the desired colors.

Eye color: #8f563b
Skin color: #eec39a
